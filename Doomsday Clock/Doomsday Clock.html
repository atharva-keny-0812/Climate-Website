                                <p>The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of the likelihood of a global catastrophe, especially from nuclear war or climate change. It was created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a group of scientists and experts concerned about the dangers posed by nuclear weapons. The clock's hands are set to represent how close the world is to a potential global catastrophe, with midnight representing the hypothetical "doomsday."</p><br>
                                
                                <p>The time on the clock is not determined by any precise scientific formula but is rather set by the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, in consultation with a Board of Sponsors that includes prominent scientists and intellectuals. The decision to move the clock's hands closer to or further from midnight is based on factors such as geopolitical tensions, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, climate change, and other global threats.</p><br>
                                    
                                <p> The Doomsday Clock has been adjusted numerous times since its inception, reflecting changes in global circumstances and the perceived level of risk. It serves as a reminder of the urgent need for action to address the existential threats facing humanity and has become an iconic symbol of the precarious state of the world.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1945: </b> The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is founded by scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project, including renowned physicists such as Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer. The organization's mission is to engage the public and policymakers on issues related to nuclear weapons, arms control, and global security.</p><br>
                                    <p><b>1947: </b> Just two years after the end of World War II and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Bulletin introduced the concept of the Doomsday Clock. The idea originated from a group of scientists who were part of the Bulletin's leadership, including physicist Eugene Rabinowitch. The clock was designed as a symbolic representation of the world's vulnerability to catastrophic destruction, particularly from nuclear war. Its hands were set to represent how close humanity was to potential global catastrophe, with midnight symbolizing the hypothetical "doomsday."<br>
                                    <span style="padding-left: 6%;">Initially, the clock was set at seven minutes to midnight. This setting reflected the perceived level of danger posed by nuclear weapons and the potential for a global nuclear conflict amid escalating Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The setting was not determined by any precise scientific formula but rather by the collective judgment of the Bulletin's scientists and experts.</span></p><br>

                                    <p><b>1949: </b> The clock was reset for the first time, to three minutes to midnight. The reason for the change was the first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union, in August 1949, which marked the beginning of the world’s nuclear arms race
                                    In 1953, United States and Soviet Union successfully tests their first hydrogen bombs which heightened the risk from nuclear weapons which further escalates the conditions of ARM RACE , this results in the advancement of Doomsday clock to 2 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1960: </b> It was set back to seven minutes to midnight because international negotiations (“spirit of Camp David”) were taking place in Geneva between U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to end nuclear testing , reflecting in temporary ease of tensions.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1963: </b> It was set back farther, to 12 minutes to midnight, after the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which banned nuclear testing in Earth’s atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.
                                    1968: United Nation involvement in Vietnam intensifies, India and Pakistan battle in 1965, Isreal and its arab neighbors renews hostilities in 1967 and development of nuclear weapons in France and China in order to stand as a global players. This all events makes the Doomsday clock to move back to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1969: </b> Nearly all of the world’s nations come together to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The deal is simple: States with nuclear weapons vow to help the treaty’s other signatories develop nuclear power if they promise not to produce weapons. This results in the set back of Doomsday Clock to 10 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1972: </b> The United States and Soviet Union sign two treaties. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) limits the number of ballistic missile launchers either country can possess. The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty seeks to stop a race for weapons designed to shoot down an adversary’s incoming nuclear missiles. This helps to further shift the clock backward to 12 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1974: </b> India tests its first nuclear weapon. The United States and Soviet Union appear to be modernizing their nuclear forces, not reducing them. This things makes the clock to advance to 9 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1980: </b> Their failure to advance SALT treaty negotiations toward disarmament, both the United States and Soviet Union have been behaving like ‘nucleoholics’ and the inability of international institutions to contain political crises move the hands of the clock forward to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1984: </b> As US-Soviet relations starts declining, The United States threatens to provoke a new arms race by seeking a space-based anti-ballistic missile system, prompting the Doomsday Clock to be set at 3 minutes to midnight.
                                    1991: The clock was reset to 17 minutes to midnight, its farthest from doomsday thus far. The decision came after the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the Soviet Union and the United States, which was an agreement designed to reduce the nuclear weapons arsenals of both countries.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1998: </b> India carries out a series of nuclear tests that catch US intelligence off guard. The tests provoke worldwide outrage, and tensions heighten when Pakistan holds its own tests only three weeks later. Russia and the United States continue to serve as poor examples to the rest of the world, with a combined total of more than 7,000 weapons aimed at each other and ready to launch within 15 minutes. This led clock to shift to 9 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>2002: </b> After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States expresses increasing concerns about nuclear weapons falling into the hands of non-state actors. The United States expresses a desire to design new nuclear weapons, especially ones that can destroy hardened and deeply buried targets. It moves the hand of the clock again to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>2007: </b> North Korea conducts a nuclear test, and many in the international community worry that Iran is working toward a bomb of its own. Meanwhile, the United States and Russia remain ready to wage nuclear war within minutes, making the clock to shifts further to 5 minutes to midnight. (Concerns about nuclear proliferation, climate change, and emerging technologies prompt the Bulletin to expand the criteria used to set the Doomsday Clock.)</p> <br>

                                    <p><b>2015: </b> Unchecked climate change, global nuclear weapons modernizations, and outsized nuclear weapons arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity. Now the clock tick at only 3 minutes to midnight because international leaders are failing to perform their most important duty—ensuring and preserving the health and vitality of human civilization.</p> <br>

                                    <p><b>2018: </b> The Doomsday Clock is moved forward to 2 minutes to midnight, the closest it has been since 1953, reflecting the heightened risks of nuclear war and climate change.</p><br>

                                                Climate Change: The impact of climate change on global security and the environment is increasingly considered. Factors such as rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to food and water supplies can contribute to instability and conflict, thus influencing the clock's time. Nevertheless, here are some major past climate change events that have influenced global consciousness and could indirectly affect perceptions of existential risk:
                                                <ol style="padding-left: 4%;">
                                                    <li>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Reports: The IPCC periodically releases comprehensive assessments of climate change, summarizing the latest scientific understanding of the issue. These reports, which began in 1988, provide policymakers and the public with crucial information about the impacts of climate change and the urgency of taking action. While the clock itself doesn't directly respond to IPCC reports, they contribute to the broader discourse on global risks.</li>
                                                    <li>Paris Agreement (2015): The adoption of the Paris Agreement marked a significant milestone in international efforts to combat climate change. Signed by nearly every country in the world, the agreement aims to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The agreement's success or failure in driving meaningful action on climate change could indirectly influence perceptions of existential risk and potentially impact the Doomsday Clock.</li>
                                                    <li>Extreme Weather Events: Events such as hurricanes, wildfires, heatwaves, and floods are becoming more frequent and severe due to climate change.

                                <p>The Doomsday Clock is a symbolic representation of the likelihood of a global catastrophe, especially from nuclear war or climate change. It was created in 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, a group of scientists and experts concerned about the dangers posed by nuclear weapons. The clock's hands are set to represent how close the world is to a potential global catastrophe, with midnight representing the hypothetical "doomsday."</p><br>
                                
                                <p>The time on the clock is not determined by any precise scientific formula but is rather set by the Bulletin's Science and Security Board, in consultation with a Board of Sponsors that includes prominent scientists and intellectuals. The decision to move the clock's hands closer to or further from midnight is based on factors such as geopolitical tensions, the proliferation of nuclear weapons, climate change, and other global threats.</p><br>
                                    
                                <p> The Doomsday Clock has been adjusted numerous times since its inception, reflecting changes in global circumstances and the perceived level of risk. It serves as a reminder of the urgent need for action to address the existential threats facing humanity and has become an iconic symbol of the precarious state of the world.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1945: </b> The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists is founded by scientists who had worked on the Manhattan Project, including renowned physicists such as Albert Einstein and Robert Oppenheimer. The organization's mission is to engage the public and policymakers on issues related to nuclear weapons, arms control, and global security.</p><br>
                                    <p><b>1947: </b> Just two years after the end of World War II and the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Bulletin introduced the concept of the Doomsday Clock. The idea originated from a group of scientists who were part of the Bulletin's leadership, including physicist Eugene Rabinowitch. The clock was designed as a symbolic representation of the world's vulnerability to catastrophic destruction, particularly from nuclear war. Its hands were set to represent how close humanity was to potential global catastrophe, with midnight symbolizing the hypothetical "doomsday."<br>
                                    <span style="padding-left: 6%;">Initially, the clock was set at seven minutes to midnight. This setting reflected the perceived level of danger posed by nuclear weapons and the potential for a global nuclear conflict amid escalating Cold War tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The setting was not determined by any precise scientific formula but rather by the collective judgment of the Bulletin's scientists and experts.</span></p><br>

                                    <p><b>1949: </b> The clock was reset for the first time, to three minutes to midnight. The reason for the change was the first atomic bomb test by the Soviet Union, in August 1949, which marked the beginning of the world’s nuclear arms race
                                    In 1953, United States and Soviet Union successfully tests their first hydrogen bombs which heightened the risk from nuclear weapons which further escalates the conditions of ARM RACE , this results in the advancement of Doomsday clock to 2 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1960: </b> It was set back to seven minutes to midnight because international negotiations (“spirit of Camp David”) were taking place in Geneva between U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to end nuclear testing , reflecting in temporary ease of tensions.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1963: </b> It was set back farther, to 12 minutes to midnight, after the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States signed the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, which banned nuclear testing in Earth’s atmosphere, outer space, and underwater.
                                    1968: United Nation involvement in Vietnam intensifies, India and Pakistan battle in 1965, Isreal and its arab neighbors renews hostilities in 1967 and development of nuclear weapons in France and China in order to stand as a global players. This all events makes the Doomsday clock to move back to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1969: </b> Nearly all of the world’s nations come together to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The deal is simple: States with nuclear weapons vow to help the treaty’s other signatories develop nuclear power if they promise not to produce weapons. This results in the set back of Doomsday Clock to 10 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1972: </b> The United States and Soviet Union sign two treaties. The Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty (SALT) limits the number of ballistic missile launchers either country can possess. The Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty seeks to stop a race for weapons designed to shoot down an adversary’s incoming nuclear missiles. This helps to further shift the clock backward to 12 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1974: </b> India tests its first nuclear weapon. The United States and Soviet Union appear to be modernizing their nuclear forces, not reducing them. This things makes the clock to advance to 9 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1980: </b> Their failure to advance SALT treaty negotiations toward disarmament, both the United States and Soviet Union have been behaving like ‘nucleoholics’ and the inability of international institutions to contain political crises move the hands of the clock forward to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1984: </b> As US-Soviet relations starts declining, The United States threatens to provoke a new arms race by seeking a space-based anti-ballistic missile system, prompting the Doomsday Clock to be set at 3 minutes to midnight.
                                    1991: The clock was reset to 17 minutes to midnight, its farthest from doomsday thus far. The decision came after the signing of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) by the Soviet Union and the United States, which was an agreement designed to reduce the nuclear weapons arsenals of both countries.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>1998: </b> India carries out a series of nuclear tests that catch US intelligence off guard. The tests provoke worldwide outrage, and tensions heighten when Pakistan holds its own tests only three weeks later. Russia and the United States continue to serve as poor examples to the rest of the world, with a combined total of more than 7,000 weapons aimed at each other and ready to launch within 15 minutes. This led clock to shift to 9 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>2002: </b> After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States expresses increasing concerns about nuclear weapons falling into the hands of non-state actors. The United States expresses a desire to design new nuclear weapons, especially ones that can destroy hardened and deeply buried targets. It moves the hand of the clock again to 7 minutes to midnight.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>2007: </b> North Korea conducts a nuclear test, and many in the international community worry that Iran is working toward a bomb of its own. Meanwhile, the United States and Russia remain ready to wage nuclear war within minutes, making the clock to shifts further to 5 minutes to midnight. (Concerns about nuclear proliferation, climate change, and emerging technologies prompt the Bulletin to expand the criteria used to set the Doomsday Clock.)</p> <br>

                                    <p><b>2015: </b> Unchecked climate change, global nuclear weapons modernizations, and outsized nuclear weapons arsenals pose extraordinary and undeniable threats to the continued existence of humanity. Now the clock tick at only 3 minutes to midnight because international leaders are failing to perform their most important duty—ensuring and preserving the health and vitality of human civilization.</p> <br>

                                    <p><b>2018: </b> The Doomsday Clock is moved forward to 2 minutes to midnight, the closest it has been since 1953, reflecting the heightened risks of nuclear war and climate change.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>2020: </b> The Doomsday Clock is moved forward to 100 seconds to midnight, the closest it has ever been to midnight. The decision reflects the heightened risks posed by nuclear weapons, climate change, disruptive technologies, and political instability.</p><br>

                                    <p><b>2023: </b> Due to the Russia-Ukraine war, the Clock now stands at 90 seconds to midnight—the closest to global catastrophe it has ever been.</p><br>
